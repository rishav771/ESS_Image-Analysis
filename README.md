## Abstract

Up until now, room lights were automated using IR sensors, which can be costly. This project proposes an energy-efficient and cost-effective method that utilizes image analysis to predict areas of a room with more people and focuses lighting on those areas. The approach leverages a CNN-based head detector model to estimate the spatially varying head size, key for head counting in dense crowds. Real-time image analysis, powered by OpenCV and PyTorch, allows for quick identification of areas with higher human presence, optimizing lighting usage.
